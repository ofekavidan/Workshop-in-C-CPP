## Programming Workshop in C & C++
As a Computer Science Student in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, I was required to take the Programming Workshop in C & C++ course.
This is a course that teaches you the basic and advanced concepts of Memory Management, OOP and Generic Programming, using C & C++ as the main languages.
It lasted 14 weeks, in which, we've submitted a total of 7 exercises in various fields and topics.
